### Requirements

Any static assets you wish to deploy from a root directory e.g. `project` must

1. live in `project/public`, and
2. be specified in an array in `project/out/public.json`.

`s3-deploy` assumes you have AWS access keys available in your environment. See [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/getting-started.html#getting-started-step2).

### Usage

```shell
∫ s3-deploy modified -p /Local/static/assets

2 files modified recently:
   build/bundle.js
   index.html
∫ s3-deploy yolo -b example.com -p /Local/static/assets -s app

Upload success for app/build/bundle.js
   Entity tag "<REDACTED>"
Upload success for app/index.html
   Entity tag "<REDACTED>"
∫
```
